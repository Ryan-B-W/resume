* list of my skills
 - Basic understanding of electrical engineering and design
 - I learned to program by myself when I was 13-14 years old
 - When I was about 7 I was learning to do rudimentary
   programing/scripting, in the context of playing a video game, to
   make my own maps, etc.
 - When I was 9 I made a trebuchete with my dad.
 - I have used Linux as my primary, and almost my exclusive, operating
   system for the past 6 or 7 years.
 - I'm quite comfortable with programming in Common LISP, Emacs LISP,
   Python, and C++.
 - I'm at least somewhat familiar with C, R, Maxima, BASH, BASIC, Lua, Scheme,
   RPL, Perl, Pascal, JavaScript, and Postscript.
